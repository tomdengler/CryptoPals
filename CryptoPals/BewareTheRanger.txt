Twelve years ago, Kaitlyn Russell had a dream: living happily ever after with Clay Morgan. Except her grandmother had bigger plans for her beloved granddaughter and they didn't include life in the small town of McKenna Springs as the wife of a young, poor deputy. Kaitlyn's heart was broken when Clay and her grandmother convinced her to pursue her second love, Broadway stardom.
Texas Ranger Clay Morgan is a widower with a young son to raise. A dozen years before, he had to make the most difficult decision of his life when he agreed to let go of the only woman he'd ever loved so that she could pursue her dreams.
Now, fate and an old woman's guilty conscience conspire to bring Clay and Kaitlyn back together once more. Will they be able to lay the past to rest and rekindle their love from the ashes?
